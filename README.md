# Github Battle

A simple app based on the curriculum of React Fundamentals by Tyler McGinnis. Features include:

1. View the most popular repositores on GitHub overall and based on languages; and
2. Battle between two users based on profile attributes.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with GitHub API credentials (to prevent being rate limited), as follows:
```
CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>
```
2. Run `npm install` to set up dependencies.
3. Run `npm run start` to run the dev server.
